# 4-20mA-Submersible-Liquid-Level-Pressure-Transducer
Arduino control of a 4-20mA submersible liquid level pressure transducer for level measurement
## Summary
Use an Arduino Mega to measure the level of a liquid by means of a 4-20mA submersible pressure transducer. By connecting a resistor in series with the transducer, the voltage across the resistor can be measured by the Arduino via an analog pin. From this voltage, the current can be calculated using Ohm's law and thereafter mapped to the liquid level. The ranges of the sensor are: 4-20mA, 0-10m, 12-36VDC.
